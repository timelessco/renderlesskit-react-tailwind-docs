# Getting Started

Renderlesskit uses tailwind to provide better styling so you'll need to install the neccesary dependencies and setup a tailwind.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @renderlesskit/react-tailwind
```

```bash
yarn add @renderlesskit/react-tailwind
```

## Tailwind setup

After setting up tailwind in your project, all you need to do inside your `tailwind.config.js` is import our `preset` function and use it.

```js
const { preset } = require("@renderlesskit/react-tailwind/preset");

module.exports = preset({
  /* your normal tailwind config */
});
```

## Setting up provider

Renderlesskit needs a theme provider which passes down all the neccesary styling for the components at the root of your app.

Go to your root of the application and add this:

```js
import * as React from "react";
// 1. import `RenderlesskitProvider` component
import { RenderlesskitProvider } from "@renderlesskit/react-tailwind";

function App() {
  // 2. Use at the root of your app
  return (
    <RenderlesskitProvider>
      <App />
    </RenderlesskitProvider>
  );
}
```

## Extending the theme

If you need to customize the default styling for any components, you can do so by extending the `defaultTheme`

Our `RenderlesskitProvider` accepts a theme prop which can be used to extend the theme.

```js
import * as React from "react";
import { RenderlesskitProvider } from "@renderlesskit/react-tailwind";

const customTheme = {
  extend: {
    buttton: {
      base: "bg-red-300",
    },
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <RenderlesskitProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <App />
    </RenderlesskitProvider>
  );
}
```

> If you are wondering about which keys of theme you can extend you can look at the source code for each specific [theme file](https://github.com/timelessco/renderlesskit-react-tailwind/tree/main/src/theme/defaultTheme)

> Or if you have setup typescript you can also get autocompletion of those theme keys. checkout [TypeScript Guide](/guides/typescript-guide)
