# Customize theme

If you need to customize the default styling for any components, you can do so by extending the `DefaultTheme`

## Extending theme tokens

Our `RenderlesskitProvider` accepts a theme prop which can be used to extend the theme.

To extend or override a token in the default theme simply add a new theme object (we called it `customTheme`) and inside of that create a new `extend` property and assign all your overrides to it.

For example, if you want to add a new `red` variant to the button you can do this:

```js
// 1. Import `RenderlesskitProvider`
import { RenderlesskitProvider } from "@renderlesskit/react-tailwind";

// 2. Extend theme
// It's recommended to put this in a separate theme.js file
const customTheme = {
  extend: {
    buttton: {
      variant: { red: "bg-red-300" },
    },
  },
};

// 3. Pass the new theme to `RenderlesskitProvider`
<RenderlesskitProvider theme={customTheme}>
  <App />
</RenderlesskitProvider>;

// 4. Now you can use these colors in your components
function Usage() {
  return <Button variant="red">Welcome</Button>;
}
```

If you are wondering about which keys of theme you can extend you can look at the source code for each specific [theme file](https://github.com/timelessco/renderlesskit-react-tailwind/tree/main/src/theme/defaultTheme)

Or if you have setup typescript you can also get autocompletion of those theme keys, checkout [TypeScript Guide](/guides/typescript-guide).
