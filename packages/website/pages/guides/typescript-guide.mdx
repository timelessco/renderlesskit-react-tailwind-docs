# TypeScript Support

Renderlesskit provides a full typesafe theming system which can be help you get
better intellisense and DX overall.

In this guide we are going to see how to setup TypeScript, and see how we can
add extra typesafe variants to component themes.

First, we need to extract our custom `theme` object into it's own file so that
we can infer it's types.

## Creating theme file

```ts
// my-theme.ts

const customTheme = {
  extend: {
    buttton: {
      variants: {
        red: "bg-red-300 text-white",
      },
    },
  },
};

export default customTheme;
```

## Creating declaration file

TypeScript definitions for the Renderlesskit's theme can be extended by using
[declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html).
So the first step is creating a declarations file. Let's name it `global.d.ts`
for example.

```ts
// global.d.ts
import { DefaultTheme } from "@renderlesskit/react-tailwind";
import theme from "./my-theme";

type UserTheme = typeof theme.extend;

declare global {
  namespace Renderlesskit {
    interface Theme {
      components: MergeTheme<DefaultTheme, UserTheme>;
    }
  }
}
```

For CRA projects you can put this content inside `react-app-env.d.ts`

Thats It!

Now if you create a new Button you'll see that there is a new variant called
`red`
