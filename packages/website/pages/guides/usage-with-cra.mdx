# Setting up CRA with Renderlesskit

First let's create a new CRA project.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-website
```

## Setup TailwindCSS

To get started with renderlesskit first step is to setup Tailwind CSS in your CRA project.
Refer to tailwind documentation for [Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Create React App project](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

After setting up tailwind in your project, all you need to do inside your `tailwind.config.js` is import our `preset` function and use it.

```js
const { preset } = require("@renderlesskit/react-tailwind/preset");

module.exports = preset({
  /* your normal tailwind config */
});
```

<Callout>
  `preset()` merges your taiwind config with renderlesskit's internal tailwind
  configs and enables certain plugins
</Callout>

## Renderlesskit Setup

After following all the steps and correctly setting up tailwind, now let's add the `RenderlesskitProvider`

Follow [Setting Up Provider](/docs/getting-started#setting-up-provider)
