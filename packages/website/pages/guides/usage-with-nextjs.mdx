# Setting up Next.js with Renderlesskit

First let's create a new Nextjs project.

```bash
npx create-next-app my-website
```

## Setup TailwindCSS

To get started with renderlesskit first step is to setup Tailwind CSS in your
CRA project. Refer to tailwind documentation for
[Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

After setting up tailwind in your project, all you need to do inside your
`tailwind.config.js` is import our `preset` function and use it.

```js
const { preset } = require("@renderlesskit/react-tailwind/preset");

module.exports = preset({
  /* your normal tailwind config */
});
```

<Callout>
  `preset()` merges your taiwind config with renderlesskit's internal tailwind
  configs and enables certain plugins
</Callout>

## Renderlesskit Setup

After following all the steps and correctly setting up tailwind, now let's add
the `RenderlesskitProvider`
